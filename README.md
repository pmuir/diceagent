# diceagent Agent

This project was scaffolded with the AgentRegistry CLI. It gives you a working
ADK Python agent wired for MCP tools and ready to publish through AgentRegistry.

## Model configuration

- Provider: **gemini**
- Model: **gemini-2.5-flash**

Update `diceagent/agent.py` if you need to switch providers, add tools, or
change the root instructions.

## Local iteration

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you haven't already.
2. From the project root run:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run diceagent
   ```

3. Use `arctl agent run .` to launch the local chat experience with docker
   compose.

## Build & publish with AgentRegistry

1. Build (and optionally push) the container image:

   ```bash
   arctl agent build . --push
   ```

2. Publish the agent so the registry can serve it to clients:

   ```bash
   arctl agent publish .
   ```

3. Share the resulting agent link or deploy it to your runtime of choice.

Need MCP servers? Use `arctl agent add-mcp` to append entries to `agent.yaml`
and re-run the build once you're happy with the configuration.
